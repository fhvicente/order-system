# order-system

A project done during programming classes at university using JSONFY, KIVY, FLASK, MYSQL AND ROUTES.
Basically it is a small ordering system for a pizzeria, which registers new customers, saves it in a database, which we can then list, delete and place orders by associating the customers in this database.

To run the program just run the app.py file
